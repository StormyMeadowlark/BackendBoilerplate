# Boilerplate Microservice

This is a standardized, 12-factor compliant boilerplate microservice intended for use within the Skynetrix platform. It follows clean architecture principles, supports event-driven design via Redis, and includes hooks for telemetry, observability, and graceful lifecycle handling.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Express-based REST API
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose
- Redis Pub/Sub event bus support
- Environment-based configuration (`.env`)
- Structured logging (Winston)
- Health check endpoint
- Graceful shutdown handler
- 12-factor principles + scalable Docker setup

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-service.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure:

   - `PORT` – Port to run the service
   - `MONGODB_URI` – MongoDB connection string
   - `REDIS_URL` – Redis for pub/sub and cache
   - `SERVICE_NAME` – Used for logging and telemetry

4. **Run the service:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

## 🩺 Health Check

The service exposes a readiness and liveness check at:

```http
GET /health
```

---

## 📊 Observability

- Logs emitted in JSON format via Winston
- Events published to Redis (or consumed via subscriptions)
- Custom metrics can be integrated with Prometheus/Grafana
- Optional front-end tracing via Hotjar if UI layer is attached

---

## ⚙️ Available Scripts

- `npm start` – Start the app
- `npm run dev` – Start with hot reload (nodemon)
- `npm run lint` – Lint using ESLint
- `npm run test` – Run unit tests

---

## 📚 Best Practices

- Log all major events (incoming requests, DB writes, pub/sub)
- Always emit events instead of making direct service-to-service calls
- Use role-based middleware if exposing public routes
- Write admin scripts as isolated CLI runners, not built-in endpoints
- Tag all telemetry logs with `tenantId` and `service`

---

## 📬 Contributing

This boilerplate is intended for internal use within Skynetrix. If you want to modify or extend it for a new service (e.g., media, CRM, vehicle, telematics), clone this repo and change the `SERVICE_NAME` identifier in config.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- CI/CD GitHub Actions template
- OpenAPI spec generator
- ML prediction endpoint scaffolding
